## Description

This project is a simple web-based daily schedule application that helps users organize their tasks for the day. Users can input tasks for different hours, and the application will visually indicate whether each hour is in the past, present, or future relative to the current time. Tasks are saved locally, allowing users to revisit and update their schedule at any time.

## Features

- **Dynamic Time Display**: The application displays the current date and time, updating in real-time using the Day.js library.
- **Hourly Task Input**: Users can input tasks for each hour of the day, between 8am and 7pm.
- **Color-Coded Time Blocks**: Each hour's time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future relative to the current time.
- **Local Storage**: User-entered tasks are saved locally, allowing them to persist even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

## Technologies

- HTML5: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- CSS3 (Bootstrap): Used for styling and layout of the application.
